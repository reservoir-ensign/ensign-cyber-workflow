    "ENSIGN creates insights by performing a tensor decomposition. This is an unsupervised machine learning method that breaks down a dataset into a configurable number of components. To perform the decomposition we need to represent Zeek Conn logs as tensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "A tensor is a multidimensional array. The number of dimensions of a tensor is commonly known as the order, while each dimension is called a mode. A tensor of order one is a vector; a tensor of order two is commonly known as a matrix. In the Cyber Workflow, we create an order four tensor using as modes the datetime, source IP, destination, IP and port. \n",
    "\n",
    "A tuple of indices identifies an element (also known as an entry or value) into the tensor. The elements of a mode are mapped to the indices for that mode in the tensor. The number of indices for a given mode is often referred to as the mode size. The indices run from 0 to the size of the mode. These data values corresponding to tensor indices are known as labels. For example, imagine the entry at indices: (0, 0, 0, 0) had the value three. The labels of those indices could be: (\"2021-10-31 12:52:00\", \"192.168.9.99\", \"192.168.12.12\", \"22\"). In English, this means that the IP 192.168.9.99 connected to IP 192.168.12.12 on port 22 on October 31st, 2021 at 12:52:00. The value three at that place in the tensor means that there were three such flows in the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modes are sorted to ease interpretability so that larger-valued indices correspond to labels later in the sorted order. e.g. 0 -> 2021-01-01 00:00:00, 1 -> 2021-01-01 00:00:01, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can apply a function to map tensor labels to bins. One example may be to apply a function mapping a timestamp to minute-size bins. When a function is used to map the labels of a mode to bins, each bin is then mapped to a single index for that mode in the tensor and each bin gets a unique label. i.e. timestamps are mapped to labels with the format yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:00. The mapping of binned-labels to their mode-indices are found in the map_mode_x.txt files. The label on line 0 has index 0, the label on line 12 has index 12, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "A tensor is termed sparse if the majority of its entries are zero. Non-zero entries give us the count of those  flows. Most real-world data is sparse, just consider our tensors representing Conn logs. If the tensor were fully dense (no zero entries), that would imply that in the time range represented by the input, there was at least one network flow for every combination of source IP, destination IP and port, during every single minute. Obviously, network hosts are not connecting to every other host on the network on every port every minute so the tensors representing network data tend to be sparse. ENSIGN is optimized for calculations on sparse tensors, and alternative data structures and methods of storage are used to prevent data explosion when dealing with large mode sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A tensor that can be formed from the scaled outer product of vectors is said to have rank 1. The rank of a tensor is the smallest number of rank 1 tensors that would need to be summed to reconstruct that tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "A tensor decomposition breaks apart a tensor into R components, where R is a positive integer known as the rank of the decomposition. If the rank is not specified as a hyperparameter, it is chosen to be the integer closest to ln(nnz), where nnz is the number of non-zero entries in the tensor. Each component comprises 4 vectors (Datetime, Source IP, Dest. IP, and Port modes) and a scalar weight. The size of each vector is equal to the size of the corresponding mode in the tensor. The entries of the vector are referred to as scores and are real values in range of -1 and 1 (or 0 and 1 for non-negative decompositions). Alternatively, scores can be organized as a set of 4 factor matrices. The columns of the factor matrix represent the component vectors along that mode. The factor matrix is correspondingly of size R columns, where R is the rank of the decomposition. Factor matrices are found in the decomp_mode_x.txt files.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can proceed to rebuild an approximation of the original tensor using its components through reconstruction. For each component, we take the outer product of the set of vectors and scale it by the componentâ€™s weight. The dimension of this outer product will equal the number of modes in the original tensor. We then sum the R 4-dimensional rank-1 tensors pointwise. Intuitively, each component captures a cluster of non-zero entries in the original tensor that are related by correlations of indices across those entries. In practice, components tend to capture specific behaviors in the originating data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of metrics about the decomposition procedure are recorded in the metrics.txt file. Among them is the \"fit\", which is how close the approximated tensor is to the original tensor. Additionally, the \"coverage\" is the percentage of the original dataset that is captured in the decomposition."
