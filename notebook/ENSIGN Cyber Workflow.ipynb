    "ENSIGN creates insights by performing a tensor decomposition. This is an unsupervised machine learning method that breaks down a dataset into a configurable number of components. To perform the decomposition we need to represent the input dataset as a tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "A tensor is a multidimensional array. The number of dimensions of a tensor is commonly known as order, while each dimension is called a mode. A tensor of order one is a vector; a tensor of order two is commonly known as a matrix. A tuple of indices identifies an element (also known as an entry or value) into the tensor. A tensor that can be formed from the scaled outer product of vectors is said to have rank 1. The rank of a tensor is the smallest number of rank 1 tensors that would need to be summed to reconstruct that tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The elements of a mode are mapped to the indices for that mode in the tensor. The number of indices for a given mode is often referred to as the mode size. These data values corresponding to tensor indices are known as labels. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can apply a function to map tensor labels to bins. One example may be to apply a function mapping a timestamp to hour-size bins. For example, a timestamp of the format yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss will be mapped to a mode of size 24, {0, 1, 2, …, 23} representing the hour of day. When a function is used to map the labels of a mode to bins, each bin is then mapped to a single index for that mode in the tensor and each bin gets a unique label.\n",
    "\n",
    "A tensor is termed sparse if the majority of its entries are zero. Most real-world data is sparse: for example, if we conceptualize Amazon’s entire online inventory as rows of a matrix, its customers as the columns, and the matrix entries as the number of times a particular customer has purchased a given product, most of the entries would be zero. ENSIGN is optimized for calculations on sparse tensors, and alternative data structures and methods of storage are used to prevent data explosion when dealing with many dimensions and large mode sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A tensor decomposition breaks apart a tensor into R components, where R is a positive integer known as the rank of the decomposition. Each component comprises M vectors, where M is the order or number of modes, and a scalar weight. (The weight factor is sometimes termed a lambda.) The size of each vector is equal to the size of the corresponding mode in the tensor. The entries of the vector are referred to as scores and are real values in range of -1 and 1 (or 0 and 1 for non-negative decompositions). Alternatively, scores can be organized \n",
    "as a set of M factor matrices, where M denotes the number of modes in the tensor. The columns of the factor matrix represent the component vectors along that mode. The factor matrix is correspondingly of size R columns, where R is the rank of the decomposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can proceed to rebuild an approximation of the original tensor using its components through reconstruction. For each component, we take the outer product of the set of vectors and scale it by the component’s weight. The dimension of this outer product will equal the number of modes in the original tensor. We then sum the R M-dimensional rank 1 tensors pointwise. Intuitively, each component captures a cluster of non-zero entries in the original tensor that are related by correlations of indices across those entries. In practice, components tend to capture specific behaviors in the originating data."
